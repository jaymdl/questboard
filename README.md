# Final Project: Questboard

The Questboard is a gamified project selection mechanism implemented by Neithan Casano in his classes. The idea is simple: the teacher creates quests (i.e. project options) that students can choose from. The students can call dibs on the quest/s that they would like to take on.

## Setup
Load `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `SECRET_KEY` from a `.env` file.
